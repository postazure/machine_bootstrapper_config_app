# Machine Bootstrapper Configuration Application

This application is intended to be hosted on the web as a static application, perhaps as a github page. As a simple react application it's goal will be to allow users to select applications and system configurations that they wish to use on a development machine. Their selections will be used to generate a script that they can execute on a new machine to reduce the tediousness of machine setup.

## Goals

1. Resumable Configuration - Their configuration should include, in addition to the installation/configuration code, a url that can prepopulate this application to the state that their configuration file was generated from.

1. Static Application - The application should be static and their for easy (and cheap) to host.

## Anti-Goals

1. No Windows support. It is not my intention to support a windows development environment at this time, possible ever. Sorry.

1. Not all inclusive. It is not my intent to try to add every possible application nor system configuration to this file. I intend to add only the options that I utilize, but I strongly encourage suggestions for additional applications and configurations.
